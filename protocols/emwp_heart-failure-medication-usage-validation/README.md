# Summary of Clinical Protocol for Validation of Heart Failure Medication Usage

The end goal of this protocol is to ensure the appropriate use of heart failure medications within the healthcare system, focusing on patients who may not have an active diagnosis of heart failure.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all patients with an active prescription for heart failure medication. From this group, a subset is considered for screeningâ€”specifically, those who do not have an active diagnosis of heart failure in their medical records. The protocol then applies exclusion criteria to refine the screening process. Diagnostic interventions are conducted to confirm the necessity of the medication or to identify alternative justifications for its use.

### Important Information:

- **Initial Population:** All patients with an active prescription for heart failure medication.
  
- **Subset for Screening:** Patients without an active heart failure diagnosis in their medical records.

- **Exclusion Criteria:**
  - Patients with a history of heart failure that is inactive or in remission.
  - Patients prescribed heart failure medication for off-label use with documented clinical justification.
  - Patients participating in a clinical trial involving heart failure medication.

- **Diagnostic Interventions:**
  1. Review of the patient's medical history and current medication list.
  2. Clinical assessment to determine the presence of heart failure symptoms.
  3. Diagnostic tests as necessary, such as echocardiogram, BNP/NT-proBNP levels, or other cardiac evaluations.

- **Conditions for Successful Screens:**
  - Confirmation of an active heart failure diagnosis through clinical assessment and diagnostic testing, leading to the continuation of the heart failure medication.
  - Identification of an alternative clinical justification for the use of heart failure medication, with appropriate documentation in the patient's medical record.
  - Discontinuation or adjustment of heart failure medication if no clinical justification is found, with a follow-up plan established for the patient.

This protocol ensures that heart failure medications are used appropriately, enhancing patient safety and optimizing treatment outcomes within the healthcare system.
